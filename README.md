Installation

To run locally:

Clone the repo git clone https://github.com/lorenasferreira/curiofy.git
Open the project folder cd curiofy
Open index.html in your browser
Double-click index.html, or
Serve with a simple HTTP server:
Python 3: python -m http.server 8000
Node (live-server): npx live-server
Note: If the project includes a package.json and a dev server, you can run: npm install npm start

(If you want, I can inspect the repo and provide exact commands.)

Usage

Navigate the UI to explore components and interactions.
Modify HTML/CSS/JS files in the src (or root) folder to customize.
Add new components under a components/ or src/ directory as needed.
Project structure (example)

index.html — main entry
css/ or styles/ — stylesheets
js/ or scripts/ — JavaScript files
assets/ — images, icons, fonts
README.md — this file
Adjust paths above if your repo uses a different layout.

Development

Keep styles modular and component-scoped where possible.
Use semantic HTML and accessible attributes (aria-*) for interactive elements.
For styling consistency, consider using variables (CSS custom properties).
Test in multiple browsers and viewports.
Suggested workflow:
